# 👀 Overview

## About these Example Branches

These branches serve as a great example of what you can build with Scaffold-eth or more generally what can be built on Ethereum.&#x20;

They are meant to guide you on your journey to becoming more familiar with Scaffold-eth and learn best practices.&#x20;

These branches are open source and you can expand on them and use them as a base for your own projects as you see fit.
